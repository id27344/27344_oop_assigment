# OOP Assignments Repository

**Student Name:** GENGA Chris  
**Student ID:** 27344  
**Course:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository contains all assignments for my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the concepts and applications of OOP, including classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Each assignment corresponds to a specific question, and the code is organized into subpackages named `q1`, `q2`, etc., for clarity and ease of navigation.

## Project Structure

- Each question’s classes are grouped in its respective subpackage.  
- A dedicated utility class (`Utils.java`) is provided at the top-level package to handle common functionality, such as printing outputs with the student ID.  
- Input validation is handled through `InputHelper.java` for consistency across all assignments.  

## How to Review

All assignments have been committed in a structured manner where each question’s classes are grouped in their respective subpackage.  

This allows a reviewer to easily navigate the repository and find the classes for any question.  

All files corresponding to the same assignment were committed at the same time, making it easy to see the full context of each program in a single commit.  

To review:  
1. Navigate to the **top right corner** of the repository and click on **"Commits"** to view all commits as they were uploaded.  
2. To view a commit in a structured way, click on the **commit**, and then click on the **icon `<>`** (extreme **right**) to browse the repository files at the state of that specific commit.
